## Process Bills with Golang

This repository (`bills`) defines a module (`github.com/aih/bills`) with one package (`main`).

To build and run this module: 
`go run github.com/aih/bills`

To build and create commands in the `bills/cmd` directory, run make (to apply the `Makefile`).


Note: These commands process many files in parallel. It may be necessary to increase the system's file-opening limits to avoid the 'too many files open' error. See, e.g. https://medium.com/@muhammadtriwibowo/set-permanently-ulimit-n-open-files-in-ubuntu-4d61064429a
