## Process Bills with Golang

This repository (`bills`) defines a module (`github.com/aih/bills`) with one package (`main`).

To build and run this module: 
`go run github.com/aih/bills`

To build and create commands in the `bills/cmd` directory, run make (to apply the `Makefile`).


Note: These commands process many files in parallel. In order to prevent problems on systems that limit open files (e.g. Ubuntu), we've added a max open files parameter in `billmeta`. In addition, to prevent crashes due to system memory limitations, on the production server, I increased file swap size to 4Gb (see https://askubuntu.com/a/1075516/686037).
